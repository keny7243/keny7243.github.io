# My Personal Website from Web Class
## I'm Kerstin, a senior majoring in Environmental Products of Design.

### I'm from Albuquerque, and I enjoy learning about biology and doing various arts and crafts. I like to create work that merges these disciplines together in some way. My favorite author currently is Bell Hooks. I spent my summer visiting family in Ethiopia.
